1. Assume I plan to use the friend_overlap function above to quantify the
similarity of two users. E.g., because 344 is larger than 1, I conclude that
Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump.

How is this approach misleading? How might you fix it?

Answer -
    friend_overlap function has been used to get the number of same accounts
    followed by the two users. for example 'DrJillStein', 'GovGaryJohnson' follows 344
    common accounts.
    So before conclude thet "Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary
    Clinton and Donald Trump" we need to look into the data we have for analysis.

    'DrJillStein', 'GovGaryJohnson' follows 344 mutual accounts
    'HillaryClinton', 'realDonaldTrump', follows 1 mutual accounts

    From this data we can not conclude that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar,
    because we have not considered the actual Data set for all these 4 users.
    Below is information we need for analysis.

    User            Number of friends
    DrJillStein     4136
    GovGaryJohnson  3052
    HillaryClinton  745
    realDonaldTrump 42

    Here if we looked in to the actual data set we can see that DrJillStein and GovGaryJohnson
    follows 4136 and 3052 account respectively, so their are highly chances of getting more
    accounts overlap. Whereas HillaryClinton and realDonaldTrump follows 745 and 42 accounts
    only, so they can't have more that 42 account overlapped between them. So we can't conclude
    that Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are more similar than Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
    This approch is misleading because of this given information is not useful for comparison of
    how two objects are similar.

    Fix to the problem -
    To conclude that we either need to take each overlapping account details into consideration.
    Like the type of people they are following then and then only we conclude how much they are similar.
    If two people follows less number of people but they follow exactly identical people then they are more similar.
    Or we can use the Cosine Similarity or Jaccard Similarity to get similarity between 2 non-empty set
    "Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non zero vectors of an inner product space
    that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0Â° is 1, and it is less than 1 for
    any other angle."

2. Looking at the output of your followed_by_hillary_and_donald function, why
do you think this user is followed by both Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump,
who are rivals? Do some web searches to see if you can find out more
information.
Answer -
    Johnson  and Hilary Clinton are political and business friends of each other and as Johnson is
    major celebrity Hilary follows  Magic Johnson. Johnson is loyal towards Democrat who supported
    Hillary in her first run for the Presidency back in 2007 and now with Clinton announcing that
    she's stands for President again, Magic's making it clear he is still supporting Hilary.
    Then great Magic Johnson, had rumored to replace Trump as the  new face of the Celebrity Apprentice
    television franchise.
    But regardless of all this information, I don't think their is any political reason for which they both
    follows the Magic Johnson. Magic is famous basketball player and anyone can follow him as sports person
    as well as he is successful business man so other people from that domain can also follow him. We can not
    tell why Donald and HIlary follows the Magic Johnson.

3. There is a big difference in how many accounts each candidate follows (Gary
Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than
50). Why do you think this is? How might that affect our analysis?
Answer-
    Why do you think this is -
        Gary Johnson follows over 3K accounts while Donald Trump follows less than
        50. I don't think this values anything. Gary Johnson might feel he is more social person
        , and trump might not feel the same. It is upto individual to follow number of people.
        Their could be reason like Donald has large number of follower but Gary has less number of follower
        so he is looking forward to connect more people to create market place and understand influence.
    How might that affect our analysis -
        As mentioned in 1st answer because of this huge difference of friends for each user, we actually can't
        analyse and or compare these users. same example from question 1.
        'DrJillStein', 'GovGaryJohnson' follows 344 mutual accounts
        'HillaryClinton', 'realDonaldTrump', follows 1 mutual accounts
        If we start analyse it by just looking at figures it makes impression that DrJillStein, GovGaryJohnson are
        more similar than Donald and HillaryClinton which is actually not true.
        Above that if we have to run the analysis to find the similarity between any two users it is not possible
        because the data set is not in the way we can use that for that analysis, we will need each user information.
        This way the Gary Johnson follows over 3K accounts, while Donald Trump follows less than 50 affects our analysis.


4. The follower graph we've collected is incomplete. To expand it, we would
have to also collect the list of accounts followed by each of the
friends. That is, for each user X that Donald Trump follows, we would have to
also collect all the users that X follows. Assuming we again use the API call
https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids, how many requests will
we have to make? Given how Twitter does rate limiting
(https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting), approximately how many
minutes will it take to collect this data?

Answer-
    Initially we have only 4 users so we did 4 API call to https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/ids
    But as we have to get their friends information (like all the users that friend follows) we need to call
    same API for every friend.
    So we calculate total number of friends each candidate has
    DrJillStein 4159
    GovGaryJohnson 3124
    HillaryClinton 748
    realDonaldTrump 42

    Total number of friends are = 4159 + 3124 + 748 + 42 = 8071
    So total number of API call will be (4 + 8070) = 8077

    So, here we have 8077 users to call API for, so total number of call will be 8077/.
    Twitter does rate limiting, so we can have 15 API call only after that we have to wait for 15 min before we call same API

    Time required to get details for all these users is

    4160/15 = 277.3333333333333 Calls with 15 request per call, each call will have 15 min waiting time
    278*15=4170 min waiting time for DrJillStein

    3125/15 = 208.3333333333333 Calls with 15 request per call, each call will have 15 min waiting time
    209*15=3135 min waiting time for GovGaryJohnson

    749/15 = 50 Calls with 15 request per call, each call will have 15 min waiting time
    50*15=750 min waiting time for HillaryClinton

    43/15 = 3 Calls with 15 request per call, each call will have 15 min waiting time
    3*15=45 min waiting time for realDonaldTrump

    so total time required for all users together is
    = 4170 + 3135 + 750 + 45
    = 8100 min - 15 min (this 15 min waiting time for 1st batch)
    = 8085 min

    "Here we have not considered the common friends (overlap friends) between 4 candidate as well overlapped friends
    of those followers. if we consider so we can reduce number of call by removing duplicate calls."

    "Also we have considered batch process per user, so it will be sequential for each user"
